# Real-Time Pose Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This Python script demonstrates real-time pose detection using OpenCV and the MediaPipe library. It captures video from a file (in this case, "vid1.mp4") and detects the pose of a person in each frame of the video. The detected landmarks and connections are then overlaid on the video.

## Overview

This script utilizes the MediaPipe library to perform pose estimation, allowing you to track key points on a person's body in real-time. The detected landmarks can be used for various applications, including fitness tracking, motion analysis, and more.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the necessary libraries by running `pip install opencv-python mediapipe`.
4. Replace `"vid1.mp4"` with the path to your own video file if needed.
5. Run the Python script.
6. The script will process the video, detecting the pose in each frame and overlaying the landmarks.
7. Press the 'q' key to exit the video window when you're done.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The programming language used for this project.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/):  Open-source computer vision library.
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/): A framework for building multimodal pipelines, including pose detection.

## Important Notes

This project provides a basic example of real-time pose detection, which can be extended for various applications. Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs and experiment with different videos.
